# Nest Tasks

NestTasks is a todo app that lets you nest tasks inside task, categorize tasks, geofence tasks to certain locations, create a notion table of your tasks and sync to it and share certain tasks or sub tasks with people.

The app is designed to make it easy for you to keep track of your tasks and to-dos, and to share them with others if needed. The nesting feature lets you create sub-tasks within tasks, so you can keep track of all the details. You can also categorize tasks, so you can easily find them later. And the geofencing feature lets you set up tasks to be triggered when you arrive at or leave a specific location.

The app also integrates with Notion, so you can create a table of your tasks and to-dos, and sync it with the app. This way, you can keep track of your tasks from anywhere. And finally, you can share certain tasks or sub-tasks with others, so they can help you get them done.

## Nesting Tasks:

There are a few todo apps that let you nest tasks inside of other tasks, and this can be a great way to keep track of smaller tasks that are part of a larger project. For example, if you're working on a project that has a few different parts, you can create a task for each part and then nest smaller tasks inside of those. This can help you stay organized and make sure that you don't forget any of the smaller details.

## Categorizing Tasks:

Categorizing tasks can also be helpful in keeping your todo list organized. For example, you might have a category for work tasks, personal tasks, and errands. This can help you quickly see what needs to be done and where your priorities lie. You can also use categories to group together similar tasks, which can be helpful if you need to do a lot of similar tasks at once.

## Geofencing Tasks:

Some todo apps let you geofence tasks, which means that you can set them to only appear when you're in a certain location. This can be helpful if you need to remember to do something when you're at a certain place, like pick up milk on the way home from work. Geofencing can also be helpful if you need to remember to do something when you're in a certain area, like pick up milk on the way home from work.

## Creating a Notion Table of Your Tasks:

If you're using Notion, you can create a table of your tasks and sync it to your todo app. This can be helpful if you need to keep track of a lot of different tasks and need a way to quickly see what needs to be done. You can also share certain tasks or sub tasks with people, which can be helpful if you're working on a project with others.

## Sharing Tasks:

Finally, some todo apps let you share certain tasks or sub tasks with other people. This can be helpful if you're working on a project with someone else and need to keep track of who is doing what. It can also be helpful if you need to remember to do something for someone else, like pick up their dry cleaning.
